# Randomized 3-Coloring Algorithm Project

This project implements a randomized 3-coloring algorithm in Rust. 
The algorithm ensures that no two adjacent nodes in a graph share the same color, following a distributed approach.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Rust**: The Rust programming language, along with Cargo (Rust's package manager).

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikolaRoncevic/randomized-distributed-node-coloring.git
cd randomized-3-coloring
```

### Setting up RUST

This may vary based on system that you are using, for linux executed following command and follow instructions

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Running tests

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
